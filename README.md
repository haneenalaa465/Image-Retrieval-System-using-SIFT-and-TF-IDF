# Image-Retrieval-System-using-SIFT-and-TF-IDF
This project implements a content-based image retrieval system using SIFT features, Bag-of-Words (BoW), and TF-IDF. It extracts local descriptors from images, clusters them into visual words, and retrieves similar images based on cosine similarity of their feature representations.
